## Main User Flow

1. A new user signs up and is assigned to either the `controlGroup` or `experimentalGroup`
   - For users in the `controlGroup`, they are treated with content from vetted, reputable sources
   - For users in the `experimentalGroup`, they are treated with content generated by artificial intelligence
   - Content includes `text`-based content (including image content generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT), and `video` content (generated by InVideo), according to user preference within their user settings
   - All data related to our application is stored within Firebase Firestore
2. The user is asked to take a proficiency survey
   - This proficiency exam covers the uesr's understanding of topics such as two-factor authentication, phishing, password security, online privacy, software updates, and more
3. Upon completion of the survey, their responses are then sent to Gemini, which returns an assignment of various levels of proficiency
   - The proficiency levels include `beginner`, `intermediate`, and `expert`
   - Depending on the proficiency level assigned to the user, they are able to skip past foundational content within the curated cirriculum
4. Based on the user's proficiency category, they are treated with content appropriate to that category.
5. After completing content (text-based or videos), the user is tested on their knowledge using a shared pool of questions standardized across both `controlGroup` and `experimentalGroup` users
6. If a user earns a passing score, they will unlock succeeding content, adding to their overall completion of our website's content. If a user fails, they will have the option to retake to earn a passing grade
7. Should the user complete 100% of all content of the website, they will be granted with a certificate demonstrating their hard work
